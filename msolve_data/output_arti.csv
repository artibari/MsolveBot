In the same there is accounting error in the Payslip and my Salary has been calculated for the month of Oct19 with additional tax deduction of almost Rs 36000(Total Tax Deduction is 47476 for Oct19). There is a wrong entry of special award in my Payslip for Rs 112000 and same has been deducted in the same Payslip but additional tax is calculated and deducted on entire gross with the special award.   Request your urgent help in correction for the same and kindly help with my original payslip and salary for Oct19 pls as it will be very very difficult for me if this amount is wrongly deducted.

Similar error was also there in my Sept19 Payslip on part of HRA Arrears addition and deduction. Request your urgent intervention with Accounts pls as every month there are wrong entries in the Payslip and this is causing mental harassment.
